Total discount sum	[Arguments]	${discount1}	${discount2}				
	[Documentation]	This Keyword calculates the total amount of the discount. Accepts two numbers in the 					
	...	parameters and returns the sum of these numbers.					
	...						
	...	For example:					
	...	${sum}= \ \ \ Total discount sum \ \ \ ${10} \ \ \ ${10} \ \ \ 					
	...	${sum}= \ \ \ 20					
	${total_discount_sum}=	math_operations.Add	${discount1}	${discount2}			
	[Return]	${total_discount_sum}					
							
Total price price with discount	[Arguments]	${product1}	${product2}	${total_discount_price}			
	[Documentation]	This Keyword calculates the total cost of the goods with discount. Accepts in the parameters

	...						
	...	For example:					
	...	${price}= \ \ \ Total price price with discount \ \ \ ${5} \ \ \ ${5} \ \ \ \ ${2}					
	...	${price}= \ \ \ 8					
	${total_price}=	math_operations.Add	${product1}	${product2}			
	${total_price_with_discount}=	Calculation of price with discount	${total_price}	${total_discount_price}			
	Log	total_discount_price ${total_discount_price}	console=true				
	Log	total_price_with_discount ${total_price_with_discount}	console=true
